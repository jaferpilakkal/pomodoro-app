# Pomodoro Timer App ⏳🍅

A simple and effective desktop productivity timer built with Python and Tkinter, based on the Pomodoro technique.

## 🧠 What is Pomodoro?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where you work in focused intervals (usually 25 minutes), followed by short breaks. After several cycles, you take a longer break. This helps maintain focus, reduce burnout, and increase productivity.

## 🚀 What This App Does

This app automates Pomodoro cycles with a clean GUI. You can:

- Start a focus (work) session
- Automatically transition to short and long breaks
- View motivational quotes to keep you going
- Hear sound alerts when sessions switch
- Track session progress visually
- Save your settings between uses

It's a lightweight personal productivity tool that helps you stay consistent with deep work sessions.
